# JWT Authentication using React

This is a simple app to demonstrate JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication using React.

Currently just a frontend app, there is scope to add backend services as required.

The app uses the following simple JWT authentication service https://github.com/dantame/interview-authentication-service.

A live demonstration can be seen here:
